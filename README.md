# ML-Project

In this project we compare different machine learning for predicting the weather the concentration of a given gas at a given point of time. From the concentration of the gases acheived we can predict the weather of that location.

<b>Machine Learning Models used:</b>
Linear regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVR.

<b>libraries used:</b>
matplotlib, numpy, pandas, sklearn
